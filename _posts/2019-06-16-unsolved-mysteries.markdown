This is a reference book redesign called 'Unsolved Mysteries'. I found this book from a book store and then I reorganized it content; Also came out a brand new system for it. 
I made this book as a file format. This book was designed in two sizes. Front matters, introductions and index was designed in one size. But to hide all the stories inside of it to react to the word of 'mysteries'. 


Besides that, I added a folded poster at the end of each story. I screen shot all the evidence from online and newspaper headlines. Presenting the possibility of resolution to people historical proposition.
